/**
 * @public
 * @function
 *
 * Returns every release the dataset has — including `archived`, `published`,
 * and mid-transition states (`archiving`, `unarchiving`, `publishing`,
 * `scheduling`).
 *
 * Use this hook when you're building a release-management UI (listing
 * releases, surfacing lifecycle controls, etc.) so a release stays visible
 * across its full lifecycle — including after it's been published or
 * archived. For perspective / content queries, prefer
 * {@link useActiveReleases}, which filters to releases that still affect
 * what's queryable.
 *
 * @returns Every release for the current project, sorted to match the order
 * used by {@link useActiveReleases}.
 * @category Releases
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * import {useAllReleases} from '@sanity/sdk-react'
 *
 * const releases = useAllReleases()
 * ```
