/**
 * Authenticates the SDK with the Sanity Dashboard's session when the app runs
 * inside the dashboard.
 *
 * The dashboard owns the session there: this provider subscribes to the token
 * the dashboard issues, writes each new value into the SDK's auth store (where
 * SDK hooks read it from), and asks the dashboard for a fresh token when a
 * request fails with a 401. Outside the dashboard it renders children
 * unchanged and the app's normal auth flow applies.
 *
 * @remarks
 * `AuthBoundary` mounts this automatically, so most apps never need it
 * directly. Mount it yourself only when your app runs inside the dashboard
 * without `AuthBoundary` — that is, the app renders its own loading and error
 * UI instead of the SDK's login flow — but still uses SDK hooks such as
 * `useQuery`, which need the dashboard's token in the auth store to
 * authenticate their requests.
 *
 * Mount it once, inside the provider that creates the Sanity instance whose
 * store should receive the token.
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * import {ResourceProvider} from '@sanity/sdk-react'
 * import {TokenRefreshProvider} from '@sanity/sdk-react/dashboard'
 *
 * function EmbeddedApp() {
 *   return (
 *     <ResourceProvider fallback={<Loading />}>
 *       <TokenRefreshProvider>
 *         <App />
 *       </TokenRefreshProvider>
 *     </ResourceProvider>
 *   )
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @public
