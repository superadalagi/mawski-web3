# `interestfor` Polyfill

A polyfill for the `interestfor` attribute. This is a new API for "interest
interactions" that is in the process of being implemented in browsers. It [shipped](https://chromestatus.com/feature/4530756656562176)
in Chromium browsers (e.g. Chrome, Edge) in version 142 (October 2025).
See the MDN documentation for more details:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Popover_API/Using_interest_invokers

## Usage
To use this polyfill, simply load it:

```html
<script src="interestfor.min.js" async></script>

<a interestfor=foo href=bar>Link</a>
<div popover id=foo>Popover</div>
```

## Behavior Summary

Adding the `interestfor` attribute to a button or link (the "interest
invoker"), and giving it a value that is the IDREF of another element (the
"target" element), will cause the target to get "interest" and "loseinterest"
events when the user "shows interest" in the interest invoker. Showing interest
can be done by hovering the element with the mouse, or focusing it with the
keyboard. If the target is a popover, it will automatically be shown and hidden
upon receiving and losing interest.

Again, this is a quick summary. For the complete details, please [read the
explainer](https://open-ui.org/components/interest-invokers.explainer).

## Touchscreen support

This polyfill provides limited touchscreen support. On a touchscreen,
long-pressing a `<button>` element that has an `interestfor` attribute will show
interest in the target.

However, long-pressing a link (`<a>` element) is **not** supported. This is
because on today's browsers, long-pressing a link element brings up a useful
context menu that contains items like "Share" and "Open in new tab". In order
for the polyfill to support interest on links, that context menu would need to
be surpressed completely. There is currently no way to provide access to the
long-press context menu and *also* provide a way to show interest. Since the
context menu contains items that users often use, eliminating access to the
context menu is not what most people want. So this polyfill will not support
long-press on links.

This is one of the primary motivations for Chromium championing this as a
native API in all browsers: to support all users, including those using
touchscreens. If you'd like to weigh in on the need for this native API,
please feel free to comment on the standards positions for the non-supporting
browsers:

- WebKit: https://github.com/WebKit/standards-positions/issues/464
- Mozilla: https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/issues/1181


## Implementation
The polyfill adds event listeners to document.body that monitor for hover
or keyboard events relevant for the `interestfor` API. When interesting
events happen to elements with the `interestfor` attribute or elements that
are the targets of those elements, it fires `interest` and `loseinterest`
events on the target of the `interestfor` attribute. If the
target is a popover, it also handles showing or hiding the popover.

Because this is a polyfill, a few things are slightly different than the
native feature:

- The CSS properties for controlling delays are implemented as custom
  properties, so you'll want to add both the regular property and the custom
  property, prefixed with `--`, to your stylesheet:

  ```css
  [interestfor] {
    interest-delay-start: 400ms;
    --interest-delay-start: 400ms;
    interest-delay-end: 200ms;
    --interest-delay-end: 200ms;
  }
  /* Or, use the shorthand: */
  [interestfor] {
    interest-delay: 400ms 200ms;
    --interest-delay: 400ms 200ms;
  }
  /* The keyword `normal` can also be used to specify the default delay: */
  [interestfor] {
    interest-delay-end: normal;
    --interest-delay-end: normal;
  }
  ```

- The CSS pseudo classes for detecting invoker and target interest states are
  implemented as regular class names, so again add both to your stylesheet:

  ```css
  :is([interestfor]:interest-source),
  [interestfor].interest-source {
    /* invoker styles */
  }
  :is([popover]:interest-target),
  [popover].interest-target {
    /* target popover styles */
  }
  ```

  Note the `:is()` wrapped around the "normal" selector for the real pseudo
  class names. This is to avoid the entire selector being invalidated if the
  browser does not recognize the native pseudo class (e.g. `:interest-source`).


## Tests

The `test/test.html` file exercises the various parts of this feature and tests
for correctness. This is a manual test, since hovering, keyboard-focusing, etc.
cannot be done programmatically. The test is capable of testing either the
polyfill (optionally minified) or the native feature. You can run tests directly
from this repo,
[here](https://mfreed7.github.io/interestfor/test/test.html).

## Browser Compatibility

This polyfill uses all standard APIs, and is therefore compatible with all
modern browsers, including Safari and Firefox.
